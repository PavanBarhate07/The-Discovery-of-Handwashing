Dr. Semmelweis's Handwashing Discovery Project

Project Overview
Welcome to the Dr. Semmelweis's Handwashing Discovery Project! This project aims to recreate and analyze the groundbreaking discovery made by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis regarding the importance of handwashing in preventing infections during childbirth. Through Python-based data analysis and visualization, we explore mortality rates at the Vienna General Hospital from 1841 to 1846, shedding light on the transformative impact of handwashing on maternal health.

Description
Childbirth in the 19th century was perilous, with child-bed fever claiming many lives. Dr. Semmelweis's historic discovery highlighted the significance of handwashing. This project delves into the historical dataset from Vienna General Hospital, analyzing mortality rates, establishing correlations, and visually portraying the profound impact of handwashing on saving lives. The Python script encapsulates the essence of Dr. Semmelweis's work, combining data science and historical insights.

Key Features
1. Historical Dataset Exploration
Explore the intricacies of the historical dataset, containing information about childbirth, patient demographics, attending doctors, and mortality rates. Gain a comprehensive understanding of the data that forms the basis of our analysis.

2. Relationship Analysis Between Variables
Utilize Python's data analysis capabilities to uncover correlations between variables over different periods. Investigate factors such as the time of childbirth, attending doctors, and mortality rates to reveal insights into the challenges faced by women during this critical period.

3. Calculations on Mortality Rates
Perform calculations using Python's NumPy library to create new variables that enable direct comparisons of mortality rates before and after the implementation of handwashing protocols. Quantify the impact of handwashing on reducing mortality rates through rigorous statistical analyses.

4. Python-based Visualizations
Harness the power of Matplotlib and Seaborn to create compelling charts, graphs, and visual representations. These visuals serve as a storytelling mechanism, illustrating the evolution of mortality rates and emphasizing the stark contrast before and after the implementation of handwashing protocols.

5. Insights into Dr. Semmelweis's Work
Delve into the historical context, challenges, and controversies surrounding Dr. Semmelweis's discovery. Reflect on the enduring relevance of his work and draw parallels with contemporary medical practices.
